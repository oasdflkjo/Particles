ðŸ”’ World's Shortest Privacy Policy

Hey there! 

This app is as private as it gets:
- We collect absolutely nothing
- We store absolutely nothing
- We sell absolutely nothing

The only data that exists is:
1. Whatever Google Play collects by default (crash reports etc.)
2. The particles you see on screen (which disappear when you close the app)
3. That's literally it

No tracking
No analytics
No nonsense

Just particles doing particle things.

That's all folks! ðŸ‘‹
