# Particles

A GPU-accelerated particle system demo for Android using OpenGL ES 3.1 compute shaders. The application demonstrates high-performance particle simulation with gravity-based behavior running entirely on the GPU.

## ⚠️ Device Compatibility

**Currently Tested Only On:**
- Google Pixel 7a
- Honor 90 Lite
- One Plus 12R

**Not working on**
- OnePlus 6 T (exitting app needs phone reboot???)

**Important Notes:**
- This project is currently optimized and tested exclusively on Google Pixel 7a
- Running with a hard 120 FPS limit
- Performance may vary on devices with different GPU capabilities
- Not officially supported on other devices at this time

## Features

- GPU-accelerated particle simulation using OpenGL ES 3.1 compute shaders
- Real-time gravity-based particle behavior
- High-performance 120 FPS rendering
- Efficient Structure of Arrays (SoA) data layout
- Hardware-accelerated graphics using OpenGL ES 3.1

## Requirements

- Android device (Optimized for Google Pixel 7a)
- GPU with OpenGL ES 3.1 compute shader support
- Android version supporting OpenGL ES 3.1+

## Installation

Clone the repository and build using Android Studio.

## Future Updates

Community testing and feedback is highly welcomed! While the project is currently tested only on Pixel 7a, I'm eager to hear about your experiences on other devices. If you'd like to help test on your device:

1. Open an issue in this repository
2. Include your device model and GPU specifications
3. Share your experience - both successes and any issues you encounter
4. (Optional) If you're technically inclined, PRs with device-specific optimizations are welcome

Your testing helps make this project better for everyone!

## Known Issues

- Performance may vary significantly on devices other than Pixel 7a
- Device compatibility is currently limited to devices supporting OpenGL ES 3.1+
