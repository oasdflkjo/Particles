# Short Description 
Open-source particle physics toy - pure interaction, no ads, no menus.

# Full Description

## About
A minimalist particle physics simulation built with OpenGL ES compute shaders. Touch the screen to create gravity points and watch as particles flow and swirl in mesmerizing patterns. No ads, no menus, just pure interaction.

## Features
- Beautiful particle physics simulation
- Smooth 120 FPS on supported devices
- Elegant purple-to-deep-purple color transitions
- Touch anywhere to create gravity points
- Pure black background for maximum contrast
- Zero UI elements - just pure interaction

## Why Open Source?
Look, we've all been there:
- "Watch this 30-second ad to continue..."
- "Subscribe to premium to remove ads!"
- "Unlock basic features for only $4.99!"
- "Rate us 5 stars to continue..."
- "Enable notifications to get 100 coins!"

Nope. None of that here. 

This is just a clean, simple particle toy. No ads. No notifications. No nonsense.
